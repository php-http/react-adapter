# Change Log

## 2.1.0 - 2017-12-20

### Changed

- Added compatibility with `react/http-client` v0.5 (compatibility with v0.4 kept)
- `ReactFactory::buildHttpClient` now accepts a `\React\Socket\ConnectorInterface` (only for `react/http-client` v0.5).
If none provided, will use React HTTP Client defaults. 

### Deprecations
- Passing a `\React\Dns\Resolver\Resolver` to `ReactFactory::buildHttpClient` is deprecated and will be removed in **3.0.0**.
To control connector behavior (DNS, timeout, etc), pass a `\React\Socket\ConnectorInterface` instead.
