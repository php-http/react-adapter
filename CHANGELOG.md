## [Unreleased]

With this release the promise `wait` function will wait for requests to complete using
[`react/async`'s `await`](https://reactphp.org/async/#await) utilizing fibers. Instead of constantly
start stopping the event loop. As such users are expected to run usage of this adapter in a fiber using
[`react/async`'s `async`](https://reactphp.org/async/#async) like:

```php
use function React\Async\async;

async(static function () {
    // Returns a Http\Promise\Promise
    $promise = $adapter->sendAsyncRequest(request);

    // Returns a Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface
    $response = $promise->wait();
})();
```

### Changed

- Use PHP 8.1 fibers as async mechanism.
- Detect supported PHP versions in range during CI instead of hardcoding them.

## [3.0.1] - 2021-10-20

### Changed

- Replaced EventFactory::create with Loop::get as the factory has been deprecated.

## [3.0.0] - 2020-12-17

### Changed

- Add full PSR-18 support.
- Work with HTTPlug 2, drop HTTPlug 1 support.
- Move to `react/http` library instead of `react/http-client`.

## [2.1.0] - 2017-12-21

### Changed

- Added compatibility with `react/http-client` v0.5 (compatibility with v0.4 kept)
- `ReactFactory::buildHttpClient` now accepts a `\React\Socket\ConnectorInterface` (only for `react/http-client` v0.5).
If none provided, will use React HTTP Client defaults.

### Deprecations
- Passing a `\React\Dns\Resolver\Resolver` to `ReactFactory::buildHttpClient` is deprecated and will be removed in **3.0.0**.
To control connector behavior (DNS, timeout, etc), pass a `\React\Socket\ConnectorInterface` instead.
